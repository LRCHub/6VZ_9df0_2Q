I spent my whole life on you
And I built you this gorgeous house
To put up with your bitched mouth
And I've thrown all my dreams right out

And I'm so selfless here
And I'm so selfless here
There's a cloud in my head
I'm so selfless here

And what do you want from me?
I've buried my own babies
And I live all alone in this empty house
I've thrown all my dreams right out

And I'm so lonely here
And I'm so lonely here
There's a cloud in my head
I'm so lonely here

So I tend the garden, tend the garden
Tend the garden, tend the garden
Tend the garden, tend the garden
Tend the garden, build the stone wall

What are you hiding? What are you hiding?
What are you hiding? Is something dirty?
Something dirty, what are you hiding?
What are you hiding? Something dirty

Where is the baby? Where is the baby?
Where is the baby? You hold the baby
You touched the baby, you must be crazy
I must be crazy, I touched the baby

Hide in the tower, hide in the tower
Hide in the tower, right in the tower
Right in the tower, right in the tower
Right in the tower

For all I care 'cause I hate your soul
And how I hate your soul
Oh, will the church protect me?
How I hate your soul

And are we leaving? Are we ever leaving?
We've got black spots in our eyes
Are we ever leaving? Nowhere
Never meant to hurt anyone
Never meant to hurt anyone
No plunge holes into the walls
But never hurt anyone
No, no one is perfect
And no, no one is perfect
We've got a hole in our heart
No, no one is perfect, oh
